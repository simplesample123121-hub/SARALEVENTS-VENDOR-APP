# Email Verification Solution with Same Email Support

## Problem
You want to maintain email verification functionality while allowing the same email address to be used for both vendor and user accounts.

## Solution: Hybrid Approach with Email Verification

### How It Works:
1. **Registration Process:**
   - User enters their original email (e.g., `john@gmail.com`)
   - System creates a unique auth email (e.g., `user_1234567890_john@gmail.com`)
   - Supabase auth user is created with the unique email
   - Confirmation email is sent to the unique email
   - User profile stores both original email and auth email

2. **Email Verification:**
   - User receives confirmation email at the unique email address
   - User clicks the confirmation link
   - Email is verified in Supabase auth
   - User can now login

3. **Login Process:**
   - User enters their original email (`john@gmail.com`)
   - System looks up the corresponding auth email
   - Login is attempted with the auth email
   - Role validation ensures correct app access

### Implementation Details:

#### 1. Registration Flow:
```dart
// Create unique email for auth
final uniqueEmail = 'user_${DateTime.now().millisecondsSinceEpoch}_$email';

// Register with unique email
final res = await Supabase.instance.client.auth.signUp(
  email: uniqueEmail,
  password: password,
);

// Store both emails in profile
final profileResult = await Supabase.instance.client.from('user_profiles').upsert({
  'user_id': res.user!.id,
  'email': email, // Original email
  'auth_email': uniqueEmail, // Auth email for login
});
```

#### 2. Login Flow:
```dart
// Find profile by original email
final profileResult = await Supabase.instance.client
    .from('user_profiles')
    .select('user_id, auth_email')
    .eq('email', email)
    .maybeSingle();

// Login with auth email
final res = await Supabase.instance.client.auth.signInWithPassword(
  email: profileResult['auth_email'],
  password: password
);
```
